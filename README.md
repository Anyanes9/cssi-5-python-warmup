# Python Day 5 Warm-up!

## Instructions:
Fork and clone this lab, then complete the drills below.

### 1. Loops and Lists Drills

1. Given the following list:
  
  `daily_temperatures = [83, 86, 85, 88, 86, 87, 92, 93]`

  Write a loop that prints each item in the list.
2. Write a function called `PrintTemperatures` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and prints each item in the list.
3. Write a function called `AverageTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the average temperature in the list.
4. Write a functions called `CountHotDays` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the number of temperatures that are above 90.
5. Write a functions called `ModeTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the most common temperature in the list. If there is more than one mode, return the first mode found.
6. Write a function called `MedianTemperature` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns the median element of the list.
7. Write a function called `Deltas` that takes a list parameter called `daily_temperatures` and returns a list of the differences between each temperature. For example, `Deltas([73, 75, 70])` should return `[2, -5]`. 

### 2. Loops and Dictionaries Drills

Given the following dictionary:

  ```python
  name_to_favorite_food = {
    'victoria' : 'pizza',
    'tim' : 'sushi',
    'cookie monster' : 'cookies',
    'pooh' : 'honey',
    'jiro' : 'sushi',
    'michelangelo' : 'pizza',
    'caesar' : 'pizza',
    'joseph' : 'frosting'
  }
  ```
1. Write a loop that prints out all the names in the dictionary.
2. Write a loop that prints out each person's name along with their favorite food
